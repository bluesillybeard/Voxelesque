# Voxelesque
Minecraft, except triangular

Voxelesque is a game I'm currently working on. The idea is to make a Minecraft clo-- parody, 
where the boring cubes are replaced with triangular prisms - instead of having squares as the top faces, they are triangles.

I watched a video (forgot exactly what, probably a cursed PhoenixSC video about hexagonal minecraft), 
and one of the comments talked about someone maybe actually making of that. I was already messing with making my own game, and this seemed like a good way to start.
After much thought, I decided that hexagons are not the bestagons in this case, so instead I opted for triangles.

So far, I've got not much of anything. I am still working on the engine, that will probably be more or less done by september or october 2021,
which is when I will start working on the game demo / proof of concept.
This demo / proof of concept will basically be pre-classic Minecraft, except triangular.



The kind of hardware I'm aiming for this game to run on is as follows:

-Core 2 Duo E6500 @3.00 ghz

-GT 730 4GB

-8GB RAM (only 1gb allocated, but I can expand this in the future)

I choose this because it is something that Minecraft runs on, and these are actually the specs of my secondary PC, 
which I will be using to test the performance of Voxelesque.



some short term goals I should achieve before I can call this a "complete game":

-launcher

-save games

-gameplay loop

-multiplayer

-basic biome-map world generation

-i'll add more
